Arch Linux's Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community supported repository for
unofficial packages. For end users, it provides a wider array packages at the
expense of package quality and requiring compilation. For AUR package
maintainers, it provides a way to contribute to the Arch Linux community without
the large time/energy devotion of a full contributor.


I manage my AUR (Arch User Repository) packages using a combination of Git
submodules and a script that automatically checks Ruby Gems and PyPI packages
for new versions.
